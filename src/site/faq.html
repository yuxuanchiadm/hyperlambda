<h1>FAQ</h1>
<h2>How do you implement this into JavaScript?</h2>
<p>
    So basically it used a lambda calculus all-in-one library written by myself in Scala called LamcalcJ.
    And cross compiled it to JavaScript using ScalaJS.
</p>
<h2>How does it prevent performance problem when deal with larger lambda term?</h2>
<p>
    First I used a technique called trampoline to optimize compiler, pretty printer and reducer.
    Smash long call stack into heap.
    So prevented any potential stack overflow exception in VM runtime.
    Then for reducer when it found and reduced one redex in lambda term.
    It doesn't restart from scratch.
    Depend on reduction strategy it will continue search next redex from current position.
</p>
<h2>Browser just stop responding when try to reduce a term that does not have normal form. Can you do something for it?</h2>
<p>
    First limit your max reduction step.
    It will still produce result when max step reached.
    Unfortunately it can't be implement in the ways that you can click a button to interrupt reduction.
    The trampoline monad itself has a backdoor that when it detected current thread is interrupted.
    It will throw an exception to abort.
    That will work in JVM but not in JS.
    Because we only have one thread in JS.
    And when some JS code is evaluating browser just stop responding.
    There is no way to interrupt current thread to stop reduction (At least by my knowledge).
</p>
<h2>Does it support custom syntax?</h2>
<p>
    Yes. But not yet implemented in frontend. PR please!
</p>
<h2>Can I know how many steps passed after reduction terminated</h2>
<p>
    Yes. But not yet implemented in frontend. PR please!
</p>
<h2>Is there an standalone version?</h2>
<p>
    Yes:
